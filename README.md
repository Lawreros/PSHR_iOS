# PSHR_iOS

This repository to to create a seperate and stable version of the previously used https://github.com/Lawreros/PSHR_v2 

This app is made to interface with the H10 Polar Strap using the `PolarBleSdk` library found on one of [Polar Strap's Official Github Repos](https://github.com/polarofficial/polar-ble-sdk).
As code and overall structure of the app is taken from `PolarBleSdk`, as per their request, the liscensing is propogated and can be found [here](https://github.com/Lawreros/PSHR_iOS/blob/main/ThirdPartySoftwareListing.txt)

### H10 Heart rate sensor
Most accurate Heart rate sensor in the markets. The H10 is used in the Getting started section of this page. 
[Store page](https://www.polar.com/en/products/accessories/H10_heart_rate_sensor)

### H10 heart rate sensor available data types
* From version 3.0.35 onwards. 
* Heart rate as beats per minute. RR Interval in ms and 1/1024 format.
* Heart rate broadcast.
* Electrocardiography (ECG) data in ÂµV with sample rate 130Hz. Default epoch for timestamp is 1.1.2000
* Accelerometer data with sample rates of 25Hz, 50Hz, 100Hz and 200Hz and range of 2G, 4G and 8G. Axis specific acceleration data in mG. Default epoch for timestamp is 1.1.2000
* Start and stop of internal recording and request for internal recording status. Recording supports RR, HR with one second sampletime or HR with five second sampletime.
* List, read and remove for stored internal recording (sensor supports only one recording at the time).

### App Functionality:
* Connects to nearest H10 heart rate sensor
* Records transmitted RR-interval and BPM measurements into a local text file, including timestamps for when the iPhone recieved the packets of data
* Records transmitted ECG data into a local text file, also including timestamps
* Plays a sound recording and vibrates whenever there has been an unexpected disconnect or ECG data is not being recorded

### Requirements
* Xcode 12.x
* Swift 5.x
## Dependencies
*  [PolarBleSdk 3.3.6](https://github.com/polarofficial/polar-ble-sdk) or above
*  [RxSwift 6.0](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) or above
*  [Swift Protobuf 1.18.0](https://github.com/apple/swift-protobuf) or above
